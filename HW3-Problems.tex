Write python functions to implement the FTCS (forward in time, centered in space) method for solving a 1D scalar advection equation
\begin{equation*}
   \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + v \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0
\end{equation*}
where $u$ is a scalar and $v$ is constant, applied to a Gaussian Wave. We showed in lecture that the basic approach
\begin{equation*}
   u_j^{n+1} = u^n_j - \frac{v \Delta t}{2\Delta x} \left( u^n_{j+1} - u^n_{j-1} \right) 
\end{equation*}
is unconditionally \emph{unstable}.  Show the instabilities growing over time in your Gaussian Wave.  Compare this to the corrected, and unconditionally \emph{stable}, Lax-Friedrich Method.
\par
Write a \LaTeX{} report discussing your results.  It should include a short explanation of the algorithms and implementation with all relevant formula and a discusion of the following:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Plots showing growing instabilities in the Gaussian Wave for the FTCS scheme.
   \item Similar plots for the stable wave from the Lax-Friedrich method.
   \item What, if any, are the restrictions on $\Delta t$ in order for Lax-Friedrichs to be stable?
\end{itemize}
Include the \texttt{.pdf} version of the report and all Python files in your homework repo.
